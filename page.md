# System.Drawing.Common replacement with Aspose.Drawing for .NET

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Creating images using graphic libraries can be a challenging task for developers, researchers, students, and managers involved in building graphic applications and services on the Microsoft .NET platform. Aspose.Drawing is a contemporary cross-platform graphic drawing library that offers advanced features and functionality. By utilizing the Aspose library for .NET platform (C#, VB.NET and other languages), developers can efficiently draw images with lines and shapes using diverse Pen and Brush objects, generate texts with varying fonts and styles, perform different transformations, and render drawings into popular graphics file formats. This readily-available graphic library significantly boosts productivity, drastically reduces development time, and accelerates time-to-market. Microsoft's System.Drawing.Common library has recently altered its support for non-Windows platforms, making Aspose.Drawing.Common API a suitable alternative for image drawings.
</p>


## System.Drawing.Common limitations

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Microsoft Learn portal published an article detailing a significant change: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/core-libraries/6.0/system-drawing-common-windows-only">System.Drawing.Common only supported on Windows</a>. If you attempt to compile a .NET 6 program using the System.Drawing.Common package on non-Windows environments, you will encounter an exception indicating that your platform is not supported. Although it is possible to disable this warning on .NET 6, it is strongly recommended to migrate to alternative libraries.
</p>

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This issue arises from the fact that cross-platform implementation of System.Drawing.Common based on the graphic library called `libgdiplus`, which includes native code and lacks necessary functionality. Additionally, `libgdiplus` has external dependencies on other 3rd party native libraries like `cairo` and `pango` on Linux platform. When using System.Drawing.Common on platforms different from Windows, you may encounter unpredictable behavior and platform errors within your drawing application. As a consequence, your rendered images may appear different on other platforms, leading to unexpected results.
</p>


## Why choose Aspose.Drawing for System.Drawing.Common replacement

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fortunately, Aspose.Drawing avoids these drawbacks by not depending on any 3rd party libraries. It includes all the necessary rendering engines for all supported platforms, ensuring consistent rendering results. Aspose.Drawing for Microsoft .NET is a robust cross-platform programming library for 2D graphics drawing. The Aspose library serves as a viable alternative to the System.Drawing.Common package. Aspose.Drawing supports .NET Standard 2.0 interface and proves to be an excellent option for developing drawing applications .NET Core 3.1, .NET 6, .NET 7 and higher, Xamarin applications for Windows, Linux, Android, Azure Functions, or Blazor WebAssembly.
</p>


## How to replace System.Drawing.Common for your project

## Aspose Drawing library use cases

### Text on image

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One of the most popular use case for 2D drawing is adding text to images, such as creating text on images for making gift cards. In the example below, we will draw a text string "Happy Birthday!" on the available space at the bottom right corner of the existing image. We will use the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/drawing/net/system.drawing/solidbrush/">`SolidBrush` tool</a> to draw the text string. You should choose the desired text color and a font with the appropriate size and style. Next, calculate the position of the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/drawing/net/system.drawing/rectangle/">`Rectangle` structure</a> to fit the text, and then draw the text string using the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/drawstring/">`DrawString` method</a>.
</p>

Example of C# code to draw text on an image:

```cs
using (var image = Image.FromFile(Path.Combine(RunExamples.GetDataDir(), "UseCases", "girl.jpg")))
{
    var graphics = Graphics.FromImage(image);

    graphics.TextRenderingHint = TextRenderingHint.AntiAliasGridFit;
    graphics.PageUnit = GraphicsUnit.Pixel;

    SolidBrush brush = new SolidBrush(Color.Navy);
    Font font = new Font("Calibri", 20, FontStyle.Italic);

    int padding = 5;

    string text = "Happy Birthday!";
    var words = text.Split(' ');

    int extentWidth = 0;
    int extentHeight = 0;

    words.ToList().ForEach(word => { var stringSize = graphics.MeasureString(word, font);
                                        extentWidth = Math.Max(extentWidth, (int)stringSize.Width + padding);
                                        extentHeight += (int)stringSize.Height; });

    Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(image.Width - padding - extentWidth,
                                        image.Height - padding - extentHeight,
                                        extentWidth,
                                        extentHeight);

    graphics.DrawString(text, font, brush, rectangle);

    image.Save(Path.Combine(RunExamples.GetDataDir(), "UseCases", "girl_card.jpg"));
}
```

<style>
   .frame {
    border: 2px solid darkgray;
    padding: 5px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    background: #f0f0f0;
    align-items: center;
   }
   .frame figcaption {
    margin: 0 auto;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: center;
   }
   .container {
   display: flex;
   flex-direction: row;
   align-items: center; 
   justify-content: space-around;
   }
</style>

<figure class="frame">
<div class="container"><div>Source image</div><div>Resulting image</div></div>
<div class="container">

    </div>
</div>
<figcaption>Frame drawing on image</figcaption>
</figure>


### Photo frame

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Moreover, you can enhance the visual appeal by creating a color frame around images or photographs. This can be easily accomplished by choosing a <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/drawing/net/system.drawing/pen/pen/">`Pen` tool</a> with your desired color and using the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/drawing/net/system.drawing/graphics/drawrectangle/">`DrawRectangle` method</a> to draw the frame with the calculated width and height.
</p>

Example of C# code to draw a color frame around a photo:

```cs
using (var image = Image.FromFile(Path.Combine(RunExamples.GetDataDir(), "UseCases", "cat.jpg")))
{
    var graphics = Graphics.FromImage(image);

    graphics.TextRenderingHint = TextRenderingHint.AntiAliasGridFit;
    graphics.PageUnit = GraphicsUnit.Pixel;

    var pen = new Pen(Color.Magenta, 1);

    int gap = 2;

    graphics.DrawRectangle(pen, 0, 0, image.Width - 1, image.Height - 1);
    graphics.DrawRectangle(pen, gap, gap, image.Width - gap - 1, image.Height - gap - 1);

    image.Save(Path.Combine(RunExamples.GetDataDir(), "UseCases", "cat_with_honor.jpg"));
}
```

<figure class="frame">
<div class="container"><div>Source image</div><div>Resulting image</div></div>
<div class="container">
    <div>
        <img src="./drawing/cat.jpg" alt="Frame drawing on image" width="476" height="268"/>
    </div>
    <div>
       <img src="./drawing/cat_with_honor.jpg" alt="Frame drawing on image" width="476" height="268"/>
    </div>
</div>
<figcaption>Frame drawing on image</figcaption>
</figure>


### Make callouts

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another useful scenario involves creating callouts on images to add supplementary information, such as diameter size details in mm. Callouts consist of several graphics primitives, and to draw them, we need to utilize various drawing methods such as <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/drawing/net/system.drawing/graphics/drawline/">`DrawLine`</a>, <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/drawing/net/system.drawing/graphics/drawellipse/">`DrawEllipse`</a>, and <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/drawstring/">`DrawString`</a>.
</p>

Example of C# code to draw callouts on an image:

```cs
// callout with size
using (var image = Image.FromFile(Path.Combine(RunExamples.GetDataDir(), "UseCases", "gears.png")))
{
    var graphics = Graphics.FromImage(image);

    graphics.TextRenderingHint = TextRenderingHint.AntiAliasGridFit;
    graphics.PageUnit = GraphicsUnit.Pixel;

    DrawCallOut(graphics, new PointF(107, 55), new PointF(179, 5), 74, "mm");

    DrawCallOut(graphics, new PointF(111, 146), new PointF(29, 180), 28, "mm");

    image.Save(Path.Combine(RunExamples.GetDataDir(), "UseCases", "gears_with_callout.jpg"));
}

void DrawCallOut(Graphics graphic, PointF startAnchor, PointF endAnchor, int value, string unit)
{
    Pen pen = new Pen(Color.LightGray, 1);

    Font font = new Font("Arial", 10, FontStyle.Bold);

    string outputValue = $"{value} {unit}";

    var textSize = graphic.MeasureString(outputValue, font);

    int diameterSymbolSize = 12;
    int spaceSize = 3;

    textSize.Width += diameterSymbolSize + spaceSize;

    float callOutMiddleX = endAnchor.X > startAnchor.X ? endAnchor.X - textSize.Width : endAnchor.X + textSize.Width;
    float callOutMiddleY = endAnchor.Y > startAnchor.Y ? endAnchor.Y - textSize.Height : endAnchor.Y + textSize.Height;

    graphic.DrawLine(pen, startAnchor.X, startAnchor.Y, callOutMiddleX, callOutMiddleY);

    float textAnchorX = Math.Min(callOutMiddleX, endAnchor.X);
    float textAnchorY = callOutMiddleY;
    graphic.DrawLine(pen, callOutMiddleX, callOutMiddleY,
                     textAnchorX == callOutMiddleX ? textAnchorX + textSize.Width : textAnchorX,
                     callOutMiddleY);

    graphic.DrawEllipse(pen, new Rectangle((int)textAnchorX + spaceSize,
                                           (int)(textAnchorY - textSize.Height) + spaceSize, 10, 10));

    graphic.DrawLine(pen, (int)textAnchorX + 1, (int)textAnchorY - 1,
                          (int)textAnchorX + diameterSymbolSize + 2,
                          (int)textAnchorY - diameterSymbolSize - 2);

    SolidBrush brush = new SolidBrush(Color.LightGray);

    graphic.DrawString(outputValue, font, brush, (int)textAnchorX + diameterSymbolSize + spaceSize,
                                                 (int)(textAnchorY - textSize.Height));
}
```

# Cross-platform drawing API for C# (.NET)

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Aspose.Drawing library provides a cross-platform C# API for creating geometric drawings. With Aspose.Drawing, you can effortlessly draw vector images such as lines, shapes, rectangles, polygons, arcs, Bezier curves, and text with various fonts and styles. Additionally, you can apply different transformations to 2D objects and save the results as raster or vector files. You can utilize the same Aspose library as a drawing API for Windows, Linux, Azure, or as a graphic API for ASP sites, ensuring consistent quality and performance across all target platforms.
</p>

## How to draw lines and shapes

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In this example, we demonstrate how to create a series of graphic primitives, including lines, rectangles, and ellipses, using the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/drawing/net/system.drawing/graphics/drawpath/">DrawPath method</a>. To start, we create a bitmap with a size of `1000x800` pixels and a color depth of 32 bits per pixel. Next, we define a Pen object with two properties: the color set to `Blue` and a width of 2
pixels, which will be used for drawing the images, along with a <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/drawing/net/system.drawing.drawing2d/graphicspath/graphicspath/">Path object</a>. Following that, we sequentially add two lines to the Path, each defined by its starting and ending X, Y coordinates: one from (100, 100) to (1000, 400), and another line from (1000, 600) to (300, 600); a Rectangle with the following specifications: left upper corner at (0, 0), width of 200, and height of 400 pixels; and an Ellipse object fitted within a rectangle, positioned at the left upper corner (10, 200), with a width of 450 and a height of 300 pixels. Using the DrawPath method and the previously described Pen object, we draw the Path onto the created bitmap. Finally, we rasterize the image and save it as a PNG file.
</p>

C# code example:
```cs
using System.Drawing;
using System.Drawing.Drawing2D;

namespace Aspose.Drawing.Examples.CSharp.LinesCurvesShapes
{
    class DrawPath
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            //ExStart: DrawPath
            Bitmap bitmap = new Bitmap(1000, 800, System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat.Format32bppPArgb);
            Graphics graphics = Graphics.FromImage(bitmap);

            Pen pen = new Pen(Color.FromKnownColor(KnownColor.Blue), 2);
            GraphicsPath path = new GraphicsPath();

## How to create geometric drawings with arcs and Bezier curves

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Similar to the previous example of 2D geometrics drawings, to draw an arc, we begin by creating a 1000x800 bitmap and then proceed to create a Pen object with the color `Blue`` and a width of `2` px. Next, we create an arc object with <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/drawing/net/system.drawing/graphics/drawarc/">method `DrawArc`</a>. As method parameters, we pass the object `Pen`` followed by rectangle coordinates where our arc will be fitted: upper left point (0, 0) and bottom right point (700, 700). And the last two parameters are begin and end angles to draw the arc: from 0 degrees to 180 degrees. Angle in degrees measured clockwise from the x-axis to the starting point of the arc.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To draw a Bezier curve, you need to utilize the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/drawing/net/system.drawing/graphics/drawbezier/">`DrawBezier` method</a>. This method takes a Pen object and four sets of coordinates representing Point objects, which are used to define the curve. The first point represents the starting point for drawing, followed by the first control point, the second control point, and finally, the ending point of the curve. The Aspose.Drawing graphic library automatically calculates and draws the Bezier curve from the starting point to the endpoint, taking into account the curve direction based on the control points.
</p>

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The C# code example to draw a Bezier curve:
</p>

```cs
Bitmap bitmap = new Bitmap(1000, 800, System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat.Format32bppPArgb);
Graphics graphics = Graphics.FromImage(bitmap);

Pen pen = new Pen(Color.FromKnownColor(KnownColor.Blue), 2);
PointF p1 = new PointF(0, 0);   // start point
PointF c1 = new PointF(0, 800);   // first control point
PointF c2 = new PointF(1000, 0);  // second control point
PointF p2 = new PointF(1000, 800);  // end point
graphics.DrawBezier(pen, p1, c1, c2, p2);

bitmap.Save(RunExamples.GetDataDir() + @"LinesCurvesShapes\DrawBezierSpline_out.png");
```

## How to render text

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Let's try a more intricate example with text drawing. We will render a text with anti-aliasing and clip it within an elliptical area. To begin, we create a graphics object using a bitmap with dimensions 1000x800 px, and then set the `TextRenderingHint` graphics property to `AntiAliasGridFit`. Next, we create a `GraphicsPath` object representing an ellipse fitted to the rectangle with coordinates from (200, 200) to (600, 400). We then clip an ellipse area that fits within the rectangle. Afterward, we create a `StringFormat` object, a `Brush` object, set the alignment, and select an appropriate font with the desired size and style. Finally, we use the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/drawing/net/system.drawing/graphics/drawstring/">`DrawString` method</a> to create a text string with the clipped ellipse area.
</p>

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The C# code example to draw a text string:
</p>

```cs
Bitmap bitmap = new Bitmap(1000, 800, System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat.Format32bppPArgb);
Graphics graphics = Graphics.FromImage(bitmap);
graphics.TextRenderingHint = TextRenderingHint.AntiAliasGridFit;

Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(200, 200, 600, 400);
GraphicsPath clipPath = new GraphicsPath();
clipPath.AddEllipse(rectangle);
graphics.SetClip(clipPath);

StringFormat stringFormat = new StringFormat();
stringFormat.Alignment = StringAlignment.Center;
stringFormat.LineAlignment = StringAlignment.Center;
Brush brush = new SolidBrush(Color.FromKnownColor(KnownColor.Blue));
Font arial = new Font("Arial", 20, FontStyle.Regular);
string text = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Maecenas sapien tellus, mattis et condimentum eget, commodo ut ipsum. Maecenas elit sapien, tempus sit amet mauris sit amet, hendrerit laoreet nisi. Nulla facilisi. Sed commodo, mauris eget porta commodo, nunc tellus volutpat mi, eu auctor diam libero vel neque. Vestibulum nec mattis dui, nec molestie nisl. Etiam in magna felis. Praesent non nulla tortor. Integer nec convallis purus. Fusce vitae mollis mauris. Cras efficitur dui at mi viverra scelerisque. Morbi quis magna elit. Nulla facilisis id ante sit amet fringilla. Sed iaculis consectetur lectus a interdum. Etiam ut sollicitudin lectus, et congue lectus.";
graphics.DrawString(text, arial, brush, rectangle, stringFormat);

bitmap.Save(RunExamples.GetDataDir() + @"Rendering\Clipping_out.png");
```

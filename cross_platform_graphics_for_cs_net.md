# Cross-platform graphics library for 2D drawing pictures for .NET

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Drawing libraries for Microsoft .NET are widely utilized for creating 2D drawing applications and services. Developing a C# (C sharp) application for image drawing that can run on multiple platforms enables you to reach a broader customer base with minimal effort. Aspose.Drawing is a cross-platform solution for .NET that supports the most popular platforms and consistently delivers excellent quality results.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Graphic libraries for .NET are not limited to the Windows platforms; they are also widely popular on other systems such as MacOS, Linux, Android, Azure Functions, ASP.NET WebApp and Blazor WebAssembly. One major advantage of Aspose.Drawing.Common is its cross-platform compatibility, allowing you to utilize it simultaneously on multiple platforms. Developing with a single library streamlines the application creation process. You can reuse code developed once across multiple platforms. Aspose.Drawing is compatible with all target platforms listed in the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspose.Drawing.Common#supportedframeworks-body-tab">Supported frameworks list</a>, making it suitable for any choice you make.

Aspose.Drawing can serve as a graphic library for various target platforms, including Windows, MacOS, Linux, Azure, ASP sites, and Blazor WebAssembly applications. In Visual Studio, you have the flexibility to create new projects and run C# programs on .NET as Console Applications on Windows, Linux, or MacOS, as Web applications using ASP.NET Core or Blazor WebAssembly. Additionally, you can utilize the same Aspose drawing library for .NET MAUI applications on mobile platforms like Android or iOS.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To run a .NET application on Linux, you simply need to have .NET installed and ensure that `Aspose.Drawing.dll` is available in your project folder. You can download the binaries from the <a href="https://downloads.aspose.com/drawing/net">official Aspose website</a>. Alternatively, you can define the API using the command line command:
</p>

```sh
> dotnet add package Aspose.Drawing
```

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Aspose.Drawing graphics library relies solely on its own rendering functions, eliminating the need to install any other 3rd party components. Furthermore, you can run C# applications with the Aspose library in a Docker container. For more information about Docker installation, please refer to the <a href="https://docs.aspose.com/drawing/net/how-to-run-aspose-drawing-in-docker/">Aspose.Drawing documentation</a>."
